# Employee Tracker

## Description
Welcome to the employee tracker!! With this application, you can create an entire database of employees, their managers, roles, and departments, all by using the command line. Click the following link to see a demonstration of this application.

Open the mysql shell in your command line and run source db/db.sql, then source db/schema.sql. 
From there you will be able to create your own database. If you would like to practice with a prepopulated database, you can run source db/seeds.sql as well.

You will also need to create a .env file with your mysql credentials:
DB_USER=yourusername
DB_PASS=yourpassword
